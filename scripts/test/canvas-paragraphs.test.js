 * canvas-paragraphs.test.js
 *
 * Paragraph preservation is the one corruption class the record manifest cannot
 * catch on its own. The hash normalizes whitespace before hashing, deliberately,
 * because Canvas rewraps lines and a hash that moved every time it did would
 * flag every clean submission. The cost of that choice is that a response which
 * arrives back as one paragraph instead of two still hashes green.
 *
 * So paragraph structure needs its own check, and it splits in two:
 *
 *   1. Does Canvas keep the break?  Only a real round trip answers that, and the
 *      first run on 2026-08-07 left it uncovered because every answer in it was
 *      a single paragraph. What that run did establish is that Canvas kept 39
 *      adjacent <p> siblings out of 50 stored elements, including all nine
 *      "My response:" labels sitting next to the paragraph beneath them. A
 *      two-paragraph answer reaches Canvas through the same mechanism:
 *      paragraphsHtml() in both renderers emits <p>a</p><p>b</p> on the HTML
 *      clipboard flavour, which is the adjacency Canvas already preserved.
 *
 *   2. Does the parser recover the break?  That is this file, and it is settled
 *      locally. htmlToText has to turn every markup shape Canvas might choose
 *      back into a blank line, and it must not invent one from a soft break.
 *
 * Runs offline, no browser, no dependencies.
